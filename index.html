          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Born in the United Kingdom in 1963 and started programming at the
            age of 14. I started my professional career at the age of 20 (1983),
            working for Chemical Bank in Cardiff. In 1986 I moved to London and
            worked in retail (Harrods), and the betting industry (William Hill),
            before moving to manufacturing in Bristol. After a few years I
            started working in the telecomunications industry, moving back to
            London working with high-capacity IVR systems (Ladbrokes Racing).
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1994 I moved to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) working as a consoltant
            helping to setup a company specialising in IVR and call center
            solutions. I moved back to th UK in 1997 to work with
            Rockwell-Collins (Avionics), but in 1998 had the opportunity to move
            back to Malaysia and start a company specialising in IVR systems.
